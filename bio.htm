        Freelancing is new for me. It is intellectually rigorous and personally challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inexperience as a freelancer rattles my concentration more than I would like. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Working as a stand-up may be a good analogy. The comedian just has their wits and memorized 
        jokes to aid their success. Inexperience fogs the perception of the comedian to know when to 
        add a bit of punch to a set-up or simply let the laughter ride before jumping back in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could say solutions to coding or design obstacles come to me instantaneously. 
      </p>

        But my experience as a somewhat older human being teaches me that exhibiting patience and humility when 
        faced with an obstacle yields positive momentum. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Embarrassment takes hold when I don&rsquo;t have an answer to a client&rsquo;s question or can&rsquo;t satisfy a 
        need of theirs. But my experiences as a micropreneur has helped to follow-thru and give the 
        difficult explanation that I don&rsquo;t know or that I can&rsquo;t complete their request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working as a freelance UI / UX designer and front-end developer has matured 
        my design and development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patience has taken root in place of passion, at least in the discovery and low-res wireframe 
        phases of the design process. Investing time during the planning portion of the design process 
        has counter-intuitively saved time during the mockup stage. Robust exploration of the visual 
        design elements and UX guidelines underpinning the layout of the UI during the creation of low-res 
        wireframes led to defined layouts leading into the final production of high-res mockups. Mockups 
        took less time because the joyous tedium of making design decisions, 
        that all designers know, was already done.

        Recent self-paced education into modern design fundamentals such as responsive design 
        and semantic markup of HTML5 also informed the process used to create websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        UI&rsquo;s were conceived to display content in browsers as small as an iPhone and up to 
        1080p displays. Details such as navigation laid out to suit mobile devices and larger images 
        and font sizes for 1080p displays are nods to responsive design theories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My formal computer science education included programming concepts of a different time and 
        sophistication to modern development. But one aspect of that education that stayed 
        with me was the value of commenting.

        Using easy to identify variable names and simple yet descriptive comments to highlight the 
        function of code make following after my work easier for fellow designers and developers.

        Communicating with clients about their wishes for the website used by their organization 
        raised my awareness of the many intricacies within client / business relationships. 
        Those business relationships refined my design knowledge and ability to empathize 
        with the business needs of my clients.
