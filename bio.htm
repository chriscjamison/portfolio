          Freelancing is new for me. It is intellectually rigorous and personally challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inexperience as a freelancer rattles my concentration more than I would like. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Working as a stand-up may be a good analogy. The comedian just has their wits and memorized 
          jokes to aid their success. Inexperience fogs the perception of the comedian to know when to 
          add a bit of punch to a set-up or simply let the laughter ride before jumping back in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I could say solutions to coding or design obstacles come to me instantaneously.

          But my experience as a somewhat older human being teaches me that exhibiting patience and humility when 
          faced with an obstacle yields positive momentum. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Embarrassment takes hold when I don&rsquo;t have an answer to a client&rsquo;s question or can&rsquo;t satisfy a 
          need of theirs. But my experiences as a micropreneur has helped to follow-thru and give the 
          difficult explanation that I don&rsquo;t know or that I can&rsquo;t complete their request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working as a freelance UI / UX designer and front-end developer has matured 
          my design and development process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patience has taken root in place of passion, at least in the discovery and low-res wireframe 
          phases of the design process. Investing time during the planning portion of the design process 
          has counter-intuitively saved time during the mockup stage. Robust exploration of the visual 
          design elements and UX guidelines underpinning the layout of the UI during the creation of low-res 
          wireframes led to defined layouts leading into the final production of high-res mockups. Mockups 
          took less time because the joyous tedium of making design decisions, 
          that all designers know, was already done.

          Recent self-paced education into modern design fundamentals such as responsive design 
          and semantic markup of HTML5 also informed the process used to create websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          UI&rsquo;s were conceived to display content in browsers as small as an iPhone and up to 
          1080p displays. Details such as navigation laid out to suit mobile devices and larger images 
          and font sizes for 1080p displays are nods to responsive design theories. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My formal computer science education included programming concepts of a different time and 
          sophistication to modern development. But one aspect of that education that stayed 
          with me was the value of commenting.
